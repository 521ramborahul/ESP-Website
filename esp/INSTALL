You have presumably downloaded the source code for ESP's web site.
Here are the steps to get the site operational on your computer:

Note: I will refer to the directory which contains this README file as '/'.

1) Create a local_settings.py file in /esp/. You can do this like so:

$ cd ./esp
$ cp local_settings.py.default local_settings.py
$ pico local_settings.py <-- set PROJECT_ROOT and LOG_FILE; use *full* paths
$ cd ..

NOTE: If you wish to change a setting in django_settings.py, override the value
in local_settings.py. To configure middleware, modify MIDDLEWARE_LOCAL.


2) Create a database_settings.py file:

$ cd ./esp 
$ cp database_settings.py.default database_settings.py
$ pico database_settings.py <-- change the database user and password
$ cd ..
