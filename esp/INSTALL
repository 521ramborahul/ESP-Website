You have presumably downloaded the source code for ESP's web site.
Here are the steps to get the site operational on your computer:

Note: I will refer to the directory which contains this README file as '/'.

1) Create a settings.py file in /esp/. You can do this like so:
 
$ cd ./esp
$ ln -s ../settings_files/default_production ./settings.py
$ pico settings.py <-- edit ESP_ROOT and set it to the _full_ path of /
$ cd ../

2) Create a database_settings.py file:

$ cd ./esp 
$ cp ../settings_files/default_database_settings ./database_settings.py
$ pico database_settings.py <-- change the database user and password

3)
