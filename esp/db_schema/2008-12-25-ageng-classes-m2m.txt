Review the script 2008-12-25-ageng-classes-m2m.py. It can be run using:
    $ ./manage.py shell
    : run ../db_schema/2008-12-25-ageng-classes-m2m.py

Actions taken by the script:
    Add a new column, program_classsubject.parent_class.
    Create an index for it (all the other foreign keys have one too, I guess).
    Copy data from the many-to-many table.
    Set NOT NULL on the column.
    Drop the old many-to-many table.
