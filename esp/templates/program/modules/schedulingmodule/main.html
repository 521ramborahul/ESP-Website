<h1>Scheduling {{ prog.niceName }}</h1>

<div id="program_form">

<p>
This is the page for assigning times and rooms to classes for {{ prog.niceName }}.  Please try <a href="/manage/{{ prog.getUrlBase }}/scheduling/refresh">refreshing everything</a> if the schedules are not updating correctly.  This can take a long time!
</p>

<p>There are a few scheduling rules obeyed by this interface; you can override them using the individual "Manage Class" pages if necessary.  You must assign a time block to a class before you can assign a classroom or resources.  If you change the time block for a class, its room and resource assignments will be deleted.  This is to ensure that you don't create a conflict by moving the class to an infeasible time.</p>

<p>The <a href="./securityschedule">Security Schedule page</a> lists all your current class schedules, by time block.</p>
