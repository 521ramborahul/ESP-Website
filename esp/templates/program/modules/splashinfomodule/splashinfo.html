<h2>Lunch Preferences</h2>
<br />
<p>
<b>*** We strongly recommend students bring their own lunch or purchase a Splash lunch. *** </b><br/>
You should not expect to be able to purchase food on campus this year, even if you did last year. Instead, we are offering catered lunch to students for 
$5 on each day. Vegetarian options are available both days.
</p>

<p>Select your lunch preference below.
<b>All meals come with chips or fruit and drink.</b>
</p>
