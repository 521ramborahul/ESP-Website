<p>
Your class selection for {{program.niceName}} has been saved. You can come back and change your class selections later, up until 2 days before {{one}} begins.
</p>

<p>
Please note, this does not <em>guarantee</em> you are enrolled for any class.
You <u>must</u> show up to HSSP on the registration day (March 3rd) to complete your registration.<br />
<br />
Also note: Please check back if you can to see if anymore classes get added! Some teachers do not register their classes until later, so you may see some after you have preregistered. You are welcome to come back and change your class selection.
<br />
<br />
In addition, the <strong>medical and liability forms</strong> must be filled out and signed by a guardian. They will be available here and on the HSSP page very shortly (by February 15th).
