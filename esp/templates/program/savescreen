<p>
You may print your <a href="Confirmation/confirmation.html">confirmation letter</a> and <a href="studentreg/">schedule</a> now.  You should bring the schedule to the first day of classes for your program.  You may bring your confirmation letter to this program's on-site registration as an additional confirmation of your registration (although your schedule should suffice); you should also read it, to learn any special information (such as on-site registration details) that you'll want to keep track of when you show up for this program.

However, <b>you are not completely finished with registration</b>.  You should come back later and finish your registration.

Thanks!
