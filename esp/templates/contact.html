<h1 style="text-align:center">What can I teach?</h1><br>

<p><b>What does "teach anything" really mean?</b></p>

<p>It means you're allowed - actually, strongly encouraged - to go out on a limb and pick those wacko subjects you never thought you could have a class about.  Splash and HSSP teachers go wild with the most off-the-wall, difficult, esoteric and funny classes they can imagine.  We will do everything we can to help you arrange musical instruments, spaces for dancing and performing, and inexpensive craft/building materials if you want to use them.  </p>

<p>Of course, you can also teach a more "normal" class, like calculus, creative writing, programming, etc.  Our students are always looking forward to a new perspective on those subjects too!</p>

<p>To get an idea, take a look at some of the other classes people have taught in the past!  You can go directly to this year's Splash catalog, and the most recent HSSP catalogs: spring 2005 and summer 2005.  Or, come up with something completely new!</p>

<p><b>What about SAT Prep and Delve?</b></p>

<p>As an SAT Prep or Delve teacher, you will follow our general curriculum (since in those program there are some objectives we have to achieve!) but have the freedom to create your own lesson plans and activities with the help of the ESP staff.</p>
