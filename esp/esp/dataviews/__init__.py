def path_v1(*args):
    '''
Finds a path from args[0] to args[1], or returns [] if they aren't related in the forward direction.

If they are both models, returns a list of strings, which represent valid field lookup paths that can filter the first based on the second. For example, path_v1(StudentRegistration, User) would return ['user'], and path_v1(StudentRegistration, ClassSubject) would return ['section__parent_class'].

If the first is a model and the second is an instance, a filter is applied to the model, subject to the constaint of the instance. Roughly, this means that path_v1(model, instance)[i] is equivalent to model.objects.filter(path_v1(model, type(instance))[i]=instance).

If the first is an instance and the second is a model, the function returns the instance of the model that is linked to the given instance. For example, path_v1(sr, User) would return sr.user, and path_v1(sr, ClassSubject) would return sr.section.parent_class (where sr is an instance of StudentRegistration).
