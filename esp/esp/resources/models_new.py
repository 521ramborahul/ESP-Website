class ResourceAssignment(HistoryPreservingModel):

  An assignment of a ClassSection to a Location and an Event, with Resources.

  A ResourceAssignment is needed for every (section, location, meeting_time)-tuple.
  This is equivalent to before (where sections were
  assigned to multiple (locations, meeting_time)-tuples), but is much clearer
  since the locations and meeting_times are now separate, stand-alone objects
  and are both represented explicitly in the assignment object. This does have
  the downside of requiring multiple ResourceAssignment objects for multi-block
  classes, and needing to update multiple objects when moving a class to a new
  time or room. But this is not a regression from previous behavior. In fact,
  this should be easier to work with, since you just need to update the
  ResourceAssignment objects by swapping the location and/or meeting_time,
  rather than needing to search for the correct (location, meeting_time)-pair and
  assigning that. For whatever hastle will still remain, I think the scheduling
  flexibility is worth it.

  Floating resources are assigned here too, rather than being separate. This
  gives the flexibility of being able to assign resources at a granular level.
  It will require care, to make sure that floating resources are assigned to
  all meeting_times where they are needed (which will usually be all of them).
  The to-be-provided methods for rescheduling a class will, by default, carry
  over the floating resources with them, but they can be dropped if the mover
  specifies that they should (perhaps because the new room has that resource
  built-in, or because that resource is not available in the new timeblock).
  Constraints checking will warn if resources are double-booked, assigned when
  not available, or different across time blocks (just in case it isn't
  intentional, in which case ignore_warnings can be set to True).
