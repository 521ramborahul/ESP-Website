Resource types
- classrooms
- equipment (projector, box of chalk)
- furnishing
- consumable, non-consumable (not usable yet)
- distance function - completely unused
- only one - if True and ResourceRequestFormSet.static_resource_requests, makeaclass form only lets you choose one of the possible choices - seems to be independent of actual Resources
- choices - uses survey's ListField
- program - can be null, for global
- autocreated - probably useless

Resource groups
- classroom + chalkboards
- example: group_id 32618, classroom + LCD projector + Classroom space (Resource type with multiple values that aren't represented as their own resources / resource types) + chalkboard + moveable tables
- not any m2m or foreign key relationship
- matching integers on resource objects
- This is used only for classroom furnishings

Resource requests (usually just a filter on resource type)
- foreign key to both section and subject
- foreign key to filtered resource type
- desired value - from ResourceType.choices

Resource assignments (resource + event) (but actually, resource + class section)
- foreign key to both section and subject
- lock level (for autoscheduler)

program resources module

static resource requests - what is this? - it is string, should probably be Boolean (not using getBooleanTag)

Resource
- num students - only used for classrooms
- group id - see above
- user - usually None, only used for teacher availability (now deprecated, not used in resources app)
- is unique - only used for resources pointing to the original, global resource types, and for things with group_id==-1 - not used in code
- event - gives availability for resource - one resource per timeslot - no direct foreign key to program - get from res_type, and from anchor of event
- identical_resources() - based on name alone, no relationship between them
- classrooms are special case, some fields used only for classrooms, many functions expect to be called on classrooms
- when checking that a class's resource requests are satisfied, only considers furnishings of the assigned room. additional assigned resources (which we don't use anyway) aren't counted
- can assign multiple rooms, but only the first is used in many instances

Uses old custom cache, possibly?
