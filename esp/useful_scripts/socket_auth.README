To start socket_auth, as www-data-mit (or appropriate user), run:
(umask 002; while true; do rm -f socket_auth/socket_auth.sock; ./socket_auth.py socket_auth/socket_auth.sock; done )


To fix connection issue:
It seems likely to work to catch the exception, do a django.db.close(). I believe that Django will automatically reopen the connection when needed.

Until the code change is made, just restart the server.
