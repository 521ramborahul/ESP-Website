To start socket_auth, as www-data-mit (or appropriate user), run:
(umask 002; while true; do rm -f socket_auth/socket_auth.sock; ./socket_auth.py socket_auth/socket_auth.sock; done )


Currently, if the postgres connection dies, socket_auth.py will exit, and the
loop will restart it. It seems likely to work to catch the exception and do a
django.db.close(). I believe that Django will automatically reopen the
connection when needed. Until that change is made, though, we just restart the
server.
