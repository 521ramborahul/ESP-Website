#
# Warning to fabfile developers.
#
# This file is executed by Fabric on the developer's host machine. Host machines
# may run Windows, Mac OS or Linux and may not have all of the esp-website
# dependencies installed. Therefore:
#
#   - Take care when importing Python modules in this file. The only modules we
#     know are present come from the standard library, Fabric, and fabtools.
#
#   - Take care when using local() to run commands locally. Make sure to
#     construct local paths using os.path.join() (here imported as join()), and
#     do not assume the presence of Unix utilies like find and sed.
#
#     In addition, use env.lbase to construct absolute paths when referring to
#     local files, since fab may be invoked from anywhere in the source tree.
